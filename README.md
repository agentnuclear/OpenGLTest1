**Just a Demo Repo for me to play around and learn OpenGL**

**So Whatâ€™s This About?** ðŸ¤”

Think of this as a gym for graphics programming muscles. Iâ€™m here to:
- Flex my C++ + OpenGL skills(It aint great but will build soon). ðŸ’ª
- Experiment, fail, and occasionally succeed in making cool visual stuff. ðŸŽ®
- This repo isnâ€™t just code; itâ€™s a journey through trials, errors, and aha moments.

**Why This Exists?**
To learn, to experiment, and to remind myself that debugging is just part of the process. Oh, and to slowly transition from "I understand OpenGL" to "I really know OpenGL."


This is mostly for my personal experiments, but if youâ€™re here and feel like adding your own flair, feel free to:
- Open an issue.
- Submit a pull request.
- Or just laugh at my code in silence.
